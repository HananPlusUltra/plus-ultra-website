To install the required Node packages before running the development server for your Next.js project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

3. Run the following command to install the dependencies specified in your `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages and their dependencies.

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

   This command will start the Next.js development server, and you will see the server running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result of your Next.js application.

Now you're ready to edit the pages of your Next.js project. The page will auto-update as you make changes to the files. Enjoy developing your Next.js application!

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
